# Midwest-USA  wiki-like webpage
Inspired by my studies (USA Culture,Business and Finance) I decided to make a little website alongside my research for the history and economics of the USA midwest.
This will hopefully make my presentation a little bit more interactive and at the same time help practice my design skills.

For this page I will be using React with Material Tailwind with aim to make a minimalistic, clean modern looking website.
